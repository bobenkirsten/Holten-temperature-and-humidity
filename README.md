# Holten-temperature-and-humidity
Project for my second home to control central heating
It is done using an ESP8266 with a DHT11 sensor.
Data is written to MQTTcloud
Data can be read from the esp and written to the esp with a mqtt client

Stuf I used:
Banggood geekcreit esp8266 with dht11 GeekcreitÂ® ESP8266 IoT Development Board + DHT11 Temperatuur en vochtigheid + Geel Blauw OLED-display SDK Programmering Wifi-module

MQTT server I used is tailor.cloudmqtt.com it's free for the things I do.
MQTT client I use is Linear MQTT Dasboard, not all clients do work easily.
